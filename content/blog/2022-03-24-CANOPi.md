If you have followed  KUKSA over the last years you know the KUKSA OBD Prototyping Platform, a Raspberry CM3-based OBD dongle. Now we are proud to present you the second iteration og the KUKSA hardware. As we are not limited to OBD anymore, a small rename was in order, so let's welcome the

# KUKSA CANOPi Platform

a Rapid Prototyping Hardware for Software Defined Vehicle Applications. So what is new?

 * Two independent [MCP251xFD](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/MCP2518FD) based [CAN-FD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_FD) interfaces. This allows you to interface classic CAN interfaces as well as CAN-FD busses in your vehicle at full line rate.
 * Based on the [Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4), which provides you a lot more features and compute power than the previous version
    * Quad Core Cortex A72 processor
    * Up to 8GB of RAM
    * Integrated wireless lan and bluetooth option
 * Support for 4 USB ports, 2 of them with USB 3.0 (USB 3.1 Gen 1)
 * [PCF85036A Realtime clock](https://www.nxp.com/products/peripherals): So your security certificates also survive (unplanned) reboots, and you have a solid time reference even without Internet connectivity
 * Most requested feature in the old version: CANOPi can be powered using a barrel jack. No need to rig OBD-plug based power solutions for your desk
 * 2 Sandwiched boards, even smaller than the first version

On top of that, we kept all the features that made the first version awesome:

 * Full support of the Raspberry Pi Ecosystem for all hardwareâ€š
 * Integrated SIM card slot and M2 slot to add 4G/5G cellular connectivity
 * Can be powered via a vehicle's [OBD Port] 
 * [STN2120 OBD-II](https://www.obdsol.com/solutions/chips/stn2120/) to access vehicle data on CAN-based OBD (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics#OBD-II) interfaces. The CANOPi can still be powered from OBD as well: Just plug it in and you are good to go
 * 100% Open Hardware: All schematics and manufacturing files are available
 

So, should you use KUKSA CANOPi for your Software Defined Vehicle Development? Watch the video and find out:
