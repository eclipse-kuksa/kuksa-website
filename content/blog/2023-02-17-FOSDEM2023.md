KUKSA has been at the FOSDEM 2023 in Brussels. We show-cased how the Eclipse KUKSA project can help to leverage the advantages of a standardized description of vehicle signals

The talk presented the architectural answer given by the Eclipse KUKSA project to leverage the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification inside a vehicle. It showed how to use KUKSA components to gather and transform the data from lower embedded layers in the vehicle, and providing them in a secure way to apps and services.
