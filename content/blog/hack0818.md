## Hacking 3 Days @ IDiAL, FH-Dortmund, for Eclipse Kuksa Features  

13 Hackers met in Dortmund on August, 28th until 30th of August to work on an end-to-end use case scenario along with new Eclipse Kuksa technologies.
**20 CQs, 2 major GitHub pull-requests, and 21035 LOCs**    were the results. Of course, the LOCs also contain content from work prior to the Hackathon.

More precisely, the **Eclipse Kuksa Appstore** was migrated to an Eclipse HawkBit Server, that transmits applications wirelessly to an Eclipse HawkBit client running on a device (Raspberry Pi) that runs the Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux + Kuksa technologies). After successfully downloading the image, an **installer** unpacks and installs the downloaded image, such that the application, downloaded from the Kuksa Appstore, is executed on the target device.
Transmissions are thereby accompanied by certificates and tokens to ensure a **secure and authenticated** data transmission and management.

Implementations are not yet merged into the Kuksa GitHub repositories since used third party content is not yet fully IP checked. As soon as this is finished, you will be able to access the new technologies available at our [Kuksa GitHub repositories](https://github.com/eclipse?utf8=✓&q=kuksa).
