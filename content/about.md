summary: "A modern car contains more than 200 millions lines of code, many of them running on powerful vehicle computers. With this shift to more computational power and faster innovation cycles, value creation for a vehicle - that is a mobility service provider -  shifts to software. Today these systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house. However, maintaining 100s of millions of lines of code in separate silos for separate product lines is neither time- nor cost effective. The open Eclipse KUKSA project aims to provide shared building blocks for connected car ecosystems usbale across the industry, providing performance, quality and scalability."

A modern car contains more than 200 millions lines of code. This code is distributed between low level embedded components and increasingly also high-performance Vehicle Computers running operating systems and technologies originated in the IT and IoT industry.

With this shift to more computational power and faster innovation cycles, value creation for a vehicle - that is a mobility service provider -  shifts to software. Today these systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house. However, maintaining 100s of millions of lines of code in separate silos for separate product lines is neither time- nor cost effective. Today mainstream OS installations of Linux, Windows and OS X probably share a lot more code between each other than vehicles from any two OEMs.

Establishing shared standards and software infrastructure for vehicle software ecosystems ranging from the vehicle itself  to the cloud increases development speed, saves cost and helps establishing markets and open platforms to various automotive players from OEMs to suppliers to third party service providers without compromising safety or security.

The open Eclipse KUKSA project aims to provide such shared building blocks for connected car ecosystems that can be shared across the industry, providing performance, quality and scalability for base services that can act a solid foundation for a variety of competing products and services. In that sense KUKSA components encourage cooperation on the plumbing, enabling competition and faster innovation cycles on the customer-value creating procelain.
