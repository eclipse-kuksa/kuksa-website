      <description>If you have followed KUKSA over the last years you know the KUKSA OBD Prototyping Platform, a Raspberry CM3-based OBD dongle. Now we are proud to present the second iteration of the KUKSA hardware. As we are not limited to OBD anymore, a small rename was in order, so let&amp;rsquo;s welcome the
KUKSA CANOPi Platform a Rapid Prototyping Hardware for Software Defined Vehicle Applications. So what is new?
Two independent MCP251xFD based CAN-FD interfaces.</description>

      <description>The DIAS project used Eclipse KUKSA to detect tampering in the exhaust cleaning system of a modern truck. Modern internal combustion engines have several advanced exhaust treatment systems to meet emission standards and legislation. In case of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for diesel engines, a catalyst (“AdBlue®”) is used as consumable. This incurs costs for the operator of diesel vehicles and provides an incentive to unlawfully circumvent those systems.
The talk presents how the Eclipse KUKSA stack has been used to realize an anti-tampering system for commercial heavy-duty trucks exhaust systems.</description>

While the automotive world is full of standards, there are not a lot of useful standards for an I(o)T world. Useful here means
Standardize on semantics, not technology only Usable across vendors, by anyone (car manufacturers, suppiers, aftermarket, third parties) Building on, or interacting with, common IT technologies One of the more useful approaches in this context is the Genivi Vehicle signal specification (VSS) (https://github.</description>

      <description>taskit GmbH has developed a Car2X Gateway, which enables standardized, secure access to the cloud for in-car software. It comes pre-installed with Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) and Eclipse Kuksa and supports multiple interfaces such as CAN bus and Automotive Ethernet.
The Gateway was created as a part of the APPSTACLE project. This project is creating an open de facto standard and an open-source implementation of a complete technology stack for connected car scenarios as well as an associated ecosystem of libraries, tools, business models, services and support - hosted by the Eclipse Foundation as the Eclipse Kuksa project.</description>

      <description>This video features an approach for connecting the Eclipse SUMO track simulation with the open source connected vehicle ecosystem Eclipse Kuksa. More precisely, Eclipse SUMO is used to simulate traffic scenarios including microscopic properties like the position or emission. The generated data of each vehicle is then be sent to the message gateway of the Kuksa IoT Cloud platform and delegated to an according example service that consumes the data.</description>

      <description>The Appstacle Turkish consortium, including Koçsistem, Otokar and Netaş, has created a Remote Driver Authentication demo based on the Eclipse Kuksa platform.
Within the project, various companies or groups of companies, have focused on several use cases that support the vision of an ecosystem for purchasing and downloading in-vehicle applications. Otokar, a vehicle manufacturer, is tasked with integrating these scenarios and testing them on real vehicles. Otokar and the rest of the Turkish consortium are focused on the driver and passenger authentication scenarios.</description>

kuksa-dev mailing list and a bi-weekly Zoom meeting every Thursday on even calendar weeks from 1-2pm (CET/CEST). HowTo contribute to Eclipse Kuksa Great that you are interested in contributing to Eclipse Kuksa. We really looking forward to receive your contribution!
In the project we agreed upon the following approach to add contributions to the project.
Meet the Definition of Done (DoD) A review took place for the code The new feature was at least once tested manually, deployed to a running test instance Clearly outline third party dependencies Definition of Done First, we have DoD for solved issues.</description>

      <description>Hacking 3 Days @ IDiAL, FH-Dortmund, for Eclipse Kuksa Features 13 Hackers met in Dortmund on August, 28th until 30th of August to work on an end-to-end use case scenario along with new Eclipse Kuksa technologies. 20 CQs, 2 major GitHub pull-requests, and 21035 LOCs were the results. Of course, the LOCs also contain content from work prior to the Hackathon.
More precisely, the Eclipse Kuksa Appstore was migrated to an Eclipse HawkBit Server, that transmits applications wirelessly to an Eclipse HawkBit client running on a device (Raspberry Pi) that runs the Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux + Kuksa technologies).</description>
